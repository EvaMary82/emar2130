## Project Title

My project is a podcast tracker. This tracker functions as a digital library that allows users to input details about podcasts that they have completed and store them. The tracker also allows users to delete podcasts that they no longer wish to keep in their library.
## Motivation

Aligning with the given brief, I settled on developing a media consumption tracking application as I am a huge consumer of digital media. As tracking applications for music and films & TV are currently already extensive, I settled on a podcast tracker. This is also because I am personally a consumer of podcasts and am interested in ways that I can track my podcast consumption.

I conducted some base-level user research in the form of surveys and interviews to determine what are the most important features that users would like to see in such a tracking application and determine a target demographic. The bright colorful aesthetics of the application and inclusions of items to track were heavily based off the data that I had collected.
